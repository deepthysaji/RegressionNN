=== Improved Neural Network Model Results ===
Dataset: California Housing Dataset
Improvements Applied:
  - Feature Engineering (3 new features)
  - RobustScaler for better outlier handling
  - Deeper architecture (4 hidden layers: 128-64-32-16)
  - Regularization (Dropout + L2)
  - Batch Normalization
  - Huber loss (robust to outliers)
  - Advanced callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau)
  - Ensemble of 3 models
