# California House Price Predictor

This project uses a neural network to predict median house values in California based on the 1990 census data.

## Project Goal
The goal is to build, train, and evaluate a regression model using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Setup and Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/deepthysaji/RegressionNN`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd house_price_predictor`

3.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    `python -m venv venv`
    `source venv/bin/activate`

4.  Install the required dependencies:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
The main exploratory work can be found in `notebooks/exploration.ipynb`. To train the model, run the script:
`python src/train_model.py`
